Clustering of user terminals in a network of satellite constellations

Detailed project description see another document named "Projet_description.doc" (in French).

Short version introduction：

This project aims to build user clusters that will be used to point the beams of a constellation of low-orbital satellites. Satellites orient their antennas to keep the satellite footprint fixed on the ground.

Here are the hypotheses and the problem posed:

  • Cluster of fixed size: 90 km in diameter

  • No constraint on the cluster center

  • Several clusters can be totally overlapped (same cluster center) or partially

  • Max throughput per cluster, 3 cases to be treated: 1Gbps, 2Gbps and 4Gbps


Objective: Try to minimize the number of clusters by grouping users into clusters that respect the constraints mentioned above.
